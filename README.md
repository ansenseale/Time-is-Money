# Time-is-Money
A public art work clock

One Frost is the operations center for Frost Bank. This work is part of a large collection on 4 floors of their new building.

Time is Money is an analog timekeeping device displaying hours, minutes and seconds. The view infers the time from the relationship of the "hands" to unmoving index marks, just like on a standard round clock. Hours on the left. Minutes on the right. Seconds and index marks occupy the middle 3 stacks.
